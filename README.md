# watchlists (stock watchlist)
A app that has the ability to organize different watchlists of stocks. Will have basic line charting and timeframes of that, as well as the news of each stock and maybe some basic company data (market cap , PE, volume). Might add news on company too if possible. Created with next.js

A sick idea for login screen is to learn how to use canvas i order to make a random generating stock price chart moving in the background. Would require learning paint api at a high level.
