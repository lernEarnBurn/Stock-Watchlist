# watchlists (stock watchlist)
A app that has the ability to organize different watchlists of stocks. Will have basic line charting and timeframes of that, as well as the news of each stock and maybe some basic company data (market cap , PE, volume). Might add news on company too if possible. Created with next.js

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
